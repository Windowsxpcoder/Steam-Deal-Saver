# Steam Deal Saver — Terms of Service

Last updated: 2025-09-24

These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your use of the Steam Deal Saver Discord bot (the “Bot”). By adding or using the Bot, you agree to these Terms.

This document describes how the Bot behaves as implemented in this repository. It is not legal advice.

## 1. Using the Bot

- The Bot is provided “as is” for informational and entertainment purposes (e.g., game deals, alerts, price history). No warranties are provided.
- You must comply with Discord’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines at all times.
- The Bot may require certain permissions to function. Server admins decide what permissions to grant. Least-privilege permissions are recommended.
- Server admins are responsible for compliance with local laws, community rules, and moderation within their servers.

## 2. Features and limitations

- Deals and game data are sourced from public APIs (e.g., Steam, IsThereAnyDeal). We do not control their accuracy or availability.
- Update logs are posted only to servers that opt in via an explicit Yes/No prompt.
- Alert messages are delivered via Discord DMs and depend on the recipient’s DM settings and Discord availability.
- The Bot may implement rate limits to protect performance and prevent abuse.
- We may change, suspend, or remove features at any time without notice.

## 3. Data and privacy

- See the Privacy Policy (PRIVACY.md) for details on what data the Bot collects and how it’s used.
- By using the Bot, you acknowledge that the Bot stores minimal server configuration and alert subscription information to provide its features.

## 4. Acceptable use

You agree not to:

- Use the Bot to violate Discord’s policies or any applicable laws.
- Attempt to disrupt or overload the Bot (e.g., spamming commands).
- Reverse engineer, copy, or repurpose the Bot’s code or data in ways that violate licenses or privacy rights.
- Use the Bot to harass or harm others.

We may restrict or block usage (including removal from servers) for violations or abuse.

## 5. Availability and support

- The Bot’s availability may be affected by hosting environment, network issues, and dependencies (e.g., public APIs, Discord outages).
- Limited support is offered via the support server. There is no guaranteed response time or uptime.

## 6. Intellectual property

- The Bot’s code in this repository is owned by its author(s) and is subject to the repository’s license.
- Third-party trademarks, names, and assets (e.g., Steam, Discord) are property of their respective owners.

## 7. Disclaimer of warranties

THE BOT IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOUR USE OF THE BOT IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

## 8. Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR DATA, ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE BOT.

## 9. Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes may be announced in the support server and/or via update logs (to servers that opted in). Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
